# Smart Pointers

Smart pointers are abstract data types that act like regular pointers (variables that store memory addresses of values) in programming, coupled with additional features like destructors and overloaded operators. They also include automatic memory management to tackle problems like memory leaks.

When a developer links memory that contains dynamically allocated data with smart pointers, they are automatically de-allocated or cleaned up.

Some smart pointer use cases include:

* Automatically de-allocating data and destructing objects
* Checking data or variables that exceed their bounds
* Reducing bugs related to the use of regular pointers
* Preserving the efficiency of the program after de-allocating data
* Keeping track of all memory addresses of a programâ€™s data/objects/variables
* Managing network connections in a program application
